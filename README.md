# aqi-ml-project
This project follows a hybrid AirPhy–ML approach for Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction by combining physics-based air quality principles with data-driven machine learning models. 
Air pollutant data (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃) is preprocessed through cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering. Physical air-dispersion relationships are incorporated as 
=constraints and derived features (AirPhy component), while machine learning regression models learn complex nonlinear patterns from the data. The hybrid framework improves prediction 
accuracy, robustness, and interpretability compared to standalone ML models, and performance is evaluated using RMSE and R² metrics.
